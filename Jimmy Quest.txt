Jimmy's Quest
 

Jimmy Neutron, the 10 year old suburban genius has a strong love for mathematics. Known for his swirly-cone hairstyle, Jimmy spends most of his time with his robotic dog and embarks on mathematic quests.
                                                                  
This time his quests is to identify distances between numbers. He considered an array of integer numbers a, a1, ..., an - 1. For each element Jimmy got to find the distance to the nearest negative number (to the element which equals to a negative number). There is at least one negative number element in the given array.

Can you work with Jimmy to write a program for this problem?
 
Input Format:
The first line contains integer n (1 = n = 2·105) — length of the array a.
The second line contains integer elements of the array separated by single spaces ( - 109 = ai = 109).
Output Format:
Print the sequence d, d1, ..., dn - 1, where di is the difference of indices between i and nearest j such that aj is a negative number. It is possible that i = j.
