Given a positive integer number, we want to generate a number sequence with the following rules:
 
If the current number is 1, the process will be terminated. 
Otherwise, if the current number is even, the next number will be n/2. 
If the current number is odd (except 1), the next number will be (3*n)+1. 
Then we turn to deal with the new number, until we get 1.
 
For example, given the first number 22, we will get {22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1}. 
The length of this sequence is 16.
 
Given the first number, your task is to write a program that finds the length of the sequence generated with the above rules. 
 
Input format:
Input indicates the first number of the sequence. Invalid entry should display a message to the user, 
 
Output format:
Output is the length of sequence we generate.
 
Business rules:
1. The input should be a positive number.If not, display "Enter a number which is greater than zero".
2. The length should not exceed beyond 100. If it exceeds,  it should display an error message "Length should not exceed more than 100".  

Note :
The Method and inputs are: void generateNumSequence(int num)
 
Sample Input 
22
Sample Output
16
