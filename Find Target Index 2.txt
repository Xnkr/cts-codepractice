Find Target index
Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
Following are the examples,

[1,3,5,6], 5 ? 2
[1,3,5,6], 2 ? 1
[1,3,5,6], 7 ? 4
[1,3,5,6], 0 ? 0

Input Format

Input consists of n+2 integers. The first integer corresponds to n, the number of elements in the array.
The next n integers correspond to the elements in the array.
The last is the target element.

Business Rules

Array should be sorted in prior. Else display “Array should be sorted in ascending”.
Array should not contain any duplicate elements. Display “Duplication not allowed” if found.
Maximum size of the array should not exceed 50. If it exceeds, display “Maximum size should not exceed more than 50”

Output Format

A numeric value which is >= 0 indicating the target index in the array.
