Printing Sheets
Ted (the popular talking bear) has been given a job at the printing firm. Looking at his previous employment
record, the firm is watching very strictly on his work product. Recently, he has been assigned a task to print
on a square sheet of dimension NxN. You may think of the sheet containing N cells of dimension 1x1each.
Since, Ted is a lazy bear, he somehow steals two stamps, a horizontal printing stamp which covers
a1*2 block and a vertical printing stamp which covers a 3*1 block. He may use these two stamps in any
order and as many times as he wants. But the sheets are old, if the sheet is stamped twice at any cell, it will
tear off. Now, there is a shipment of sheets coming with varying sizes. But he observes that in some of the
cases it is not possible to completely fill the square sheet with no overlapping stamps. So, he asks for your
help in deciding whether it is possible to fill the square sheet with the stamps without any overlapping.
