SumOfPairs
Given an array of integers and a number K, write a program to find whether the given array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by K. Assume that the maximum size of the input array is 50.

Example:

Input: arr[] = {9, 7, 5, 3}, K = 6
Output: TRUE
We can divide array into (9, 3) and (7, 5).
Sum of both of these pairs is a multiple of 6.

Business Rules

Display "-1" if any of the input array element is negative.
The value of K should always be an even number, display "Invalid Input" if violates.

Input Format

Input consists of an integer array followed by K. Refer sample input for details.

Output Format

Output is a boolean value. Refer sample output for details.
